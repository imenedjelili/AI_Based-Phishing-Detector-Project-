### **Problem Definition & Project Scope for AI-Based Phishing Detection System**

---

### **1. Problem Definition**  

#### **1.1. What is Phishing?**  
Phishing is a cyberattack technique where attackers impersonate legitimate entities (such as banks, social media platforms, or email providers) to trick users into revealing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, credit card details, or personal data. This can occur through emails, fake websites, SMS, or social engineering tactics.

#### **1.2. Why is Phishing Detection Important?**  
- **Growing Threat:** Phishing attacks are among the most common and dangerous cyber threats, affecting individuals and businesses worldwide.  
- **Evolving Tactics:** Attackers continuously refine their techniques, making traditional rule-based detection methods ineffective.  
- **High Financial & Security Impact:** Phishing leads to financial fraud, identity theft, and data breaches.  

#### **1.3. Challenges in Phishing Detection**  
- **Dynamic Nature:** Phishing patterns change frequently, requiring adaptive detection mechanisms.  
- **Imbalanced Data:** Legitimate websites vastly outnumber phishing websites, leading to class imbalance issues.  
- **Feature Extraction Complexity:** Identifying relevant features from website URLs, HTML content, and metadata requires advanced techniques.  
- **False Positives & False Negatives:** High accuracy is essential, as misclassifications can have serious security implications.

### **2. Project Scope**  

#### **2.1. Goal of the Project**  
To develop a **deep learning-based phishing detection system** capable of accurately classifying URLs or webpages as **legitimate or phishing** by analyzing key attributes such as website structure, URL patterns, and other behavioral indicators.

#### **2.2. Key Functionalities of the System**  
- **Real-Time Detection:** Classify websites or URLs instantly.  
- **High Accuracy:** Minimize false positives (flagging legitimate websites) and false negatives (missing phishing sites).  
- **Adaptive Learning:** Update detection models periodically to adapt to new phishing strategies.  
- **Scalability:** Support large-scale deployment in enterprises, web browsers, or cybersecurity tools.  
- **Explainability:** Provide interpretable results to help users understand why a site is classified as phishing or legitimate.  

#### **2.3. Target Users**  
- **Individuals & Internet Users:** Protect users from falling victim to phishing scams.  
- **Organizations & Enterprises:** Prevent employees from accessing malicious links.  
- **Cybersecurity Teams:** Enhance security monitoring and threat intelligence.  
- **Web Browsers & Email Services:** Integrate phishing detection into security features.  

#### **2.4. System Inputs & Outputs**  
- **Input:**  
  - URLs of websites.  
  - Website metadata (e.g., domain age, SSL certificate status).  
  - Webpage content (HTML, JavaScript).  

- **Output:**  
  - **Phishing (1) or Legitimate (0)** classification.  
  - Risk score or confidence level for the classification.  
  - Explanation of detected phishing indicators.
